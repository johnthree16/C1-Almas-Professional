Almas Professional--
This is my initial Capstone project while enrolled in the 'Flexible Web Development Bootcamp' via online computer coding academy (https://www.thinkful.com/).

Almas Professional Summary--
This app will allow correspondence between myself and the user, with the main objective being the user's request for my professional services.
The user will be afforded the oppurtunity to see my photograph, as to enhance the human aspect of a profession that by and large
does it's dealings via back and forth communication over a multitude of electronic devices, rather than in person.
The app will provide an icon style link to my Linkedin page which has purposefully been placed in the header for ease of access upon arrival.
The app will provide a detailed overview of the skills I offer my clients, and or any company that may be interested in correspondence.
The app will then allow the user the ability to complete a form that includes a request of their name, email address as well
as a 1000 character limit text box to describe in detail how I may be of assistance to them, or the company that they represent.
After completing a reCAPTCHA test, submission of said information will be sent to my email.

UX--
Meant to be a stress free experience for the user, this app was designed to be overly welcoming.  The main thought process behind
it's structure and simplicity was taylor made to give the user a glimpse into the passion that will be present at any of their future endeavors that include my participation.  Pastel orange hues pave the way for the stress free aesthetics. While perusing the professional page of any candidate for employment, a sub-conscious comfort in every aspect of their work is viewed by some, as paramount.
